Fork of NetBSD Larn for Linux/MacOS/OpenBSD: https://github.com/r7st/larn

Notable Changes:
Builds on Linux/MacOS/OpenBSD with GNU make.
Standing on items/stairs/fountains/etc. does not prompt for interaction unless you press "g".
Running will stop before a visible trap, rather than on top of it.
Saves can be backed up without the game considering it cheating.

Compile with GNU make:
On Linux/MacOS: "make"
On *BSD: "gmake"

Play with:
./larn
