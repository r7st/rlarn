Fork of NetBSD Larn for Linux: https://github.com/r7st/larn

Notable Changes:
Builds on MacOS - not just Linux
Standing on items/stairs/fountains/open doors/etc. does not prompt for interaction unless you press 'g'.
Charisma stat improves/worsens shop prices by 1% per level above/below 12.
Saves can be backed up without the game considering it cheating.
Basic weapons/armor renamed for flavor, no stat changes. Potions renamed to tinctures.

Compile with gnu make:
On Linux/MacOS: `make`
On *BSD: `gmake`

Play with:
./larn
